# What is GitHub


GitHub is a website where you store and manage code (or any project).

It uses Git, a tool for version control (keeping track of changes in your code).



## Git vs GitHub

Git → A tool you install locally to track code changes.

GitHub → A cloud platform where you upload ("push") your Git-tracked projects

## Important Git Commands 
### git init 
  - Start a new Git repository locally 
### git clone <repo-url> 
  - Copy (download) a repo from GitHub 
### git status 
  - Check changes in your project 
### git add . 
  - Stage all changes for commit
### git commit -m "your message" 
  - Save the changes with a message (-m=message)
### git push 
  - Send your commits to GitHub 
### git pull 
  - Get the latest code from GitHub to your local 
## Common GitHub Actions

- Create a repository

- Clone a repository

- Push code to GitHub

- Pull (download) code from GitHub

- Create branches

- Make a Pull Request (PR)

## cd stands for Change Directory
  It’s a command used in the terminal (or command prompt) to move from one folder to another on your computer.
### cd Commands:
- cd .. → Go one folder back (up to the parent directory).

- cd / → Go to the root directory.

- cd (alone) → Takes you to your home directory.
## Branch
A branch is a copy of your project where you can make changes without affecting the main code.

You usually work in branches when developing a new feature, fixing bugs, or testing something new.

After you are done, you can merge the branch back into the main project.
### Basic Git Branch Commands
### git branch 
    - Show a list of all branches in your project
### git branch branch-name 
    - Create a new branch
### git checkout branch-name	
    - Switch (move) to another branch
### git checkout -b branch-name	
    - Create and switch to a new branch immediately
### git merge branch-name	
    - Merge a branch into the current branch
### git branch -d branch-name	
    - Delete a branch (after merging it)
